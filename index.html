        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Poppy Northcutt's life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Poppy — born Frances Northcutt in 1943 — grew up in Dayton, Texas
            where she found a love for mathematics early on.
          </li>
          <li>
            She showed tremendous potential in the field, going on to work as a
            NASA contractor shortly after graduating from the University of
            Texas in 1965.
          </li>
          <li>
            Her work as a vocal feminist sent her to law school, where she
            pursued a career in prosecuting domestic violence cases upon her
            graduation in 1981.
          </li>
